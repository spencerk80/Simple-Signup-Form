# A simple sign-up form for a fictional Eeveelution fan club

## UPDATE
This now has better validation using regex. For example, an email address has to be of format *stuff*@*stuff*.*stuff*
This also has a second page that loads when "submit" is clicked which shows the info entered by the user, minus the password for obvious reasons.

## old

~~This has some basic js validations to play with and will show you "submitted" when all validations pass.
The "submitted" notification appears under the form for one second and then goes away again~~
